# MOONWORKS GAME TEMPLATE

[WORK IN PROGRESS]

This template is a stripped down version of [ROLL AND CASH: GROCERY LORDS](https://github.com/thatcosmonaut/GGJ2024), a game made in 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2024 using the [MoonWorks](https://github.com/MoonsideGames/MoonWorks) game framework.

The goals of this template are to:
- Make it easier to get started making games with MoonWorks
- Provide a bare bones example of how to organize a project with Just Enough structure to get to the fun part quickly
- Make it easy to rip out the example code and make it your own
- Make a template that easily runs on on Windows, Linux, and MacOS ARM chips (M1, M2, etc)
- Clean up the C# formatting in the original Roll and Cash template project.
- Stay up to date with all dependencies
- Implement an in-game ImGui inspector as an example of how to build your tooling into the game, itself. 

NOTE: You will need to run the ContentBuilderUI project first. This will generate the content files necessary to build and run the game.
